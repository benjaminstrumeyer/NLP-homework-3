## Assignment 2

### How To Run

To run the application you need to have NodeJS installed on your machine. Then follow these steps to run the app:

* Extract the archive that contains the assignment to a folder.
* At the root of the folder, open up a terminal or a command prompt and type `npm install`.
* After npm finishes installing the dependencies, in the same terminal, type in `node ./dist/Index.js`.
* Application should be running now and showing the prompt for available commands.

### Project Structure

The archive contains a Git repository for the assignment. The directory structure is as follows:

* `src` - Contains the source code of the application written in Typescript.
* `dist` - Contains the Typescript code transpiled into Javascript. This is probably not human readable.
* `data` - Contains the `train.txt` and the `test.txt` files.
* `output` - Should contain any output files related to the assignment.

Everything else in there is metadata required to build and compile the application.
